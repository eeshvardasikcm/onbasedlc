Chess and baseball theory combined hypothetically for the creation of a new game idea
________
Explanation:
There's a general saying that the "best offense is a good defense".
In baseball the importance of good pitching may be expressed when we say "you can't win
without good pitching".
I may speculate a hypothesis that ground ball pitchers allow for a better offense. If the defense
is strong in the infield, then the outfielders can be of utopian offensive production. Realistically,
some fly ball pitchers need to be sent to the mound and there is a minimum defensive quality
that should play outfield. Historically we may see that good defensive players are not as likely to
have as much offensive potency as weaker defensive players. This strategy shows that it may
not be sufficient to conclude on acquiring an offensive outfield as the primary guiding factor in
signing new players. If we start by acquiring ground ball pitchers and good defensive infielders,
then we can see that automatically the outfield defense is not part of the primary equation.

- The concept of this new game is a combination of chess and baseball. If you notice the difference between balls hit into play in the infield as opposed to the outfield, you will see that there is a difference in the amount of time it takes for the ball to be fielded. A ball hit into the outfield takes more time to field than a ball hit into the infield. Also, the ball travels a greater distance when hit to the outfield.

- Taking a look at the markup I made of baseball players assigned as chess pieces and positioned into the field, you can note that rooks and Queens may have more offensive power, while knights and pawns cover a smaller distance quickly as opening moves. Bishops could play SS because they cover ground more quickly than a 2B. If we replace the rooks in the outfield with bishops, then we can get a different offensive and defensive dynamic.

- A new game could theoretically be created by continuing to make abstract connections between baseball and chess along these patterns.

- The difference between outfield and infield is a good place to create two separate zones in the new game. These zones may either be connected closely or have a vast space between them.

- Offensive and defensive play could possibly be separated into two different playing spaces as well, especially when we use baseball statistics to explain how one defense can field several different offenses.

- Chess championship finals scores look similar to innings of a baseball game, especially since MLB put the automatc runner on second during covid negotiations. It is now extremely rare for baseball games to extend beyond a thirtenth inning. This fact should act as a container to prevent spaces and zones possibilities from expanding beyond enjoyable, meaningful, and exciting play.
