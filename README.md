Chess and baseball theory combined hypothetically for the creation of a new game idea
________
Explanation:
There's a general saying that the "best offense is a good defense"
In baseball the importance of good pitching may be expressed when we say "you can't win
without good pitching".
I may speculate a hypothesis that ground ball pitchers allow for a better offense. If the defense
is strong in the infield, then the outfielders can be of utopian offensive production. Realistically,
some fly ball pitchers need to be sent to the mound and there is a minimum defensive quality
that should play outfield. Historically we may see that good defensive players are not as likely to
have as much offensive potency as weaker defensive players. This strategy shows that it may
not be sufficient to conclude on acquiring an offensive outfield as the primary guiding factor in
signing new players. If we start by acquiring ground ball pitchers and good defensive infielders,
then we can see that automatically the outfield defense is not part of the primary equation.
